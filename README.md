### Applying SDLC model:
  - The choice of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model for a plant disease detection project depends on various factors such as project size, complexity, requirements, and the development team's expertise. Here's a SDLC models that could be suitable for such a project:
## Agile Model:
### Overview:
  - Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. Well-suited for projects with evolving requirements and a need for quick iterations.
  - Requires active customer involvement and may not be suitable for projects with fixed timelines.
   

### Advantages:
  - Customer involvement and feedback are encouraged throughout the development process.
  - Allows for frequent adjustments and improvements based on customer feedback.
  - Facilitates early and continuous delivery of a working product.
    
### Key Practices:
  - Iterative development with regular releases (sprints).
  - Daily stand-up meetings for collaboration and communication.
  - Customer involvement in sprint reviews.
  - Continuous integration and deployment.
    
### Deployment:
  - Continuous deployment practices can be employed to ensure that the latest version of the app is always available.
  - Release increments of the software regularly, allowing users to experience and provide feedback on new features.
### Continuous Testing:

  - Implement automated testing to ensure the quality of the code.
  - Conduct regular testing throughout the development process, addressing issues as they arise.

### Conclusion:
  - By adopting an Agile approach, we can respond to changing requirements, deliver value incrementally, and ensure that the plant disease detection system evolves based on real-world feedback and user needs.
